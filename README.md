DESCRIPTION
-----------
Alrc-termux is a framework designed to enrich the Termux user experience by providing bash shell configuration and useful plugins."

INSTALLATION
------------

### REQUIREMENTS
- Install the application with the [Termux App](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/),
[Termux API](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux.api/), the [Termux Widget](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux.widget/) and the Optional Termux Float
- Enough basic tools like git, curl, grep, sed, gawk, bc, cut and more.
- Ran \`termux-setup-storage' first and Uncomment or write `allow-external-apps = true` in ~/.termux/termux.properties.
- This requires the environment variable export PATH="$PATH:/system/bin " set to be used for the \`input' and \`am' commands.

### Test & Testing
#### test
> GUI: Test with the termux widget. If you don't want to mess up your .bash_profile, put the file ~/local/share/alrc-termux/test/.shortcuts/alrc.test To ~/.shortcuts/alrc.test Then make the Termux widget run from there, if it doesn't show up do the refresh.

> CLI: shot on terminal with 

```
bash ~/.shortcuts/alrc.test 
```

#### testing

- [x] Termux
- [x] Ztmexluis
- [x] Acode Terminal (Plugin Acode)
- [ ] AndroidIDE (Terminal) But some gui features and features that require fire extinguishers won't work.
- [ ] Nix-on-droid But some gui features and features that require fire extinguishers won't work.
- [ ] Proot-distro (Experimental)
- [ ] Replit (Just for testing purposes)
- [ ] Wayland (Not working Alif said)

BUGS
----
- The al option, namely al_ab, cannot be exported to environment variables. I don't know why that can.
- On my device The imjpgrand automation feature won't consistently select the image viewer even if I press "Select always" in the end the solution was that one of the apps had to be uninstalled. I kept the zarchiver viewer and deleted the other one.
- Be careful installing other dotfiles, it can cause unwanted bugs/errors due to misconfiguration. first uninstall alrc-termux if you want to try using other dotfiles. termux-desktop causes imjpgrand to not work and other weird bugs.
- MI Music and DMP Music player are tested, brandomusicv only tested on mi music player version 6.4.20i other than that version does not work (solution uninstall update or change to another supported music player).



ROADMAP
-------

DEV: I no longer create scripts for the .shortcuts folder "It was tiring" but requests will still be accepted just not our priority anymore.

DEV: I welcome new plugin support ideas
